\chapter{Digital and Analog Input}
While the Arduino looks imposing to many (``It doesn't have a screen!''), it is actually a very simple computer. It has the ability to read digital input (whereby we can ascertain if something is on or off), read analog input (where we can tell if something is between 0V and 5V), and it can also ``write'' these same values.
